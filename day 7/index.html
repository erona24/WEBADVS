        THE FOREST REVERIE <br><br>

’Tis said that when <br>
The hands of men <br>
Tamed this primeval wood, <br>
And hoary trees with groans of wo, <br>
Like warriors by an unknown foe,<br>
Were in their strength subdued,<br>
The virgin Earth <br>
Gave instant birth <br>
To springs that ne’er did flow <br>
That in the sun <br>
Did rivulets run, <br>
And all around rare flowers did blow <br>
The wild rose pale <br>
Perfumed the gale, <br>
And the queenly lily adown the dale <br>
(Whom the sun and the dew <br>
And the winds did woo), <br>
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew. <br>
